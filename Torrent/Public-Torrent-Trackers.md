## ⚠️ Important Notes

- These are public trackers.
- Anyone can use them.
- Trackers do NOT store your files.
- They only help peers discover each other.
- For best results, enable DHT and PeX in your torrent client.

---

## 🚀 Best Practice

- Add multiple trackers for better peer discovery.
- Forward the same listening port for TCP + UDP if sharing globally.
- For local network sharing, port forwarding is not required.

---

## 🔒 Use Responsibly

Only share:

- Your own files
- Open-source software
- Public domain content

Do not share copyrighted material.

Torrent is a powerful technology — use it responsibly.
