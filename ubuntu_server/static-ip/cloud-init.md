## ‚òÅÔ∏è What is Cloud-Init?

**Cloud-Init** is a tool used in Ubuntu and other Linux distributions to **automate the initial system setup** when a virtual machine (VM) or server boots for the first time. It is commonly used in **cloud environments** like:

- AWS EC2  
- Microsoft Azure  
- Google Cloud  
- DigitalOcean  
- OpenStack  

Cloud-Init can perform tasks such as:

- Setting the **hostname**
- Adding **SSH keys** for remote access
- Installing **packages** (e.g., `nginx`, `docker`)
- Configuring **network interfaces**
- Creating **users** and setting passwords
- Running custom **startup scripts**

## ‚úÖ When to Enable Cloud-Init

Enable or keep Cloud-Init enabled if:

- You're using a **cloud provider** like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud
- You want **automatic provisioning** from cloud images
- You're using **Terraform**, **Ansible**, or other automation tools
- You want to set up VMs using **cloud-init configuration files**

Cloud-Init simplifies automation in dynamic, cloud-based deployments.

## üö´ When to Disable Cloud-Init

Disable Cloud-Init if:

- You're setting up a **personal server**, **local VM**, or **home lab**
- You're manually configuring a **static IP address** using Netplan
- You don‚Äôt need automatic SSH key injection, hostname changes, or user creation
- You want full **manual control** over your system settings

Disabling Cloud-Init can help avoid conflicts and reduce boot time in non-cloud environments.

## üí° Pro Tip

You likely **don‚Äôt need Cloud-Init** if:

- You installed Ubuntu manually (not from a cloud image)
- You've already set up your **hostname**, **users**, and **networking**
- You want a **clean, lightweight setup** with no background automation tools
