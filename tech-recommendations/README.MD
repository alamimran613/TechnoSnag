# 🧰 Tech Recommendations (TechnoSnag)

Welcome to my recommendations page — a curated list of tech products and subscriptions I genuinely suggest for developers/DevOps learners and content creators.
I’ll keep this page updated as I test new tools, buy new gear, and find better value options.

Use it when you want a quick “what should I buy/use?” reference without wasting time comparing too many options.
